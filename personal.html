    <h1> Personal life</h1>

    <p> I appreicate good perspective and try to have a great attitude no matter what life
      throws at me.
      This attitutude allows me to enjoy the things i love, like my hobbies,friends, and family. I have 2 sisters who i
      love very much and appreciate much more as i grow up,
      as well as two great parents and an amazing girlfriend. I enjoy outdoor activities like golfing, running, and
      going
      to the gym but like to decompress by going to music festivals every
      once in a while.
