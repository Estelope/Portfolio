  <h1> Personal life</h1>

  <p> I appreicate good perspective and try to have a great attitude no matter what life
    throws at me.
    This attitutude allows me to enjoy the things i love, like my hobbies,friends, and family. I have 2 sisters who i
    love very much and appreciate much more as i grow up,
    as well as two great parents and an amazing girlfriend. I enjoy outdoor activities like golfing, running, and going
    to the gym but like to decompress by going to music festivals every
    once in a while.
